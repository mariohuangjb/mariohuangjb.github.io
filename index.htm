            <p>In 2008, I received a Bachelor's degree from the <a href='https://ualberta.ca/'>University of Alberta</a> in pure mathematics (with first class honour). </p>

            <p>In the same year, I moved to Waterloo and started my graduate study in algebraic combinatorics at the department of <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/'>Combinatorics and Optimization</a> at the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>University of Waterloo</a>. After completing my Master's program under the guidance of <a href='http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~dgwagner/'>David Wagner</a> in 2009, I completed my Ph.D. in 2014 under the guidance of <a href='http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cgodsil/'>Chris Godsil</a>. My theses can be found below.</p>

            <p><strong>M.Math Thesis: </strong><a href='https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/4958'>A characterization of LYM and rank logarithmically concave partially ordered sets and its applications</a> <br>
	       <strong>Ph.D. Thesis: </strong><a href='https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/8618'>Bipartite distance-regular graphs of diameter four</a></p>

            <p>In 2014, I taught elementary algebra and linear algebra at the University of Waterloo as a sessional lecturer for two terms.</p>

            <p>In 2016, I relocated to Shenzhen and started working as a lecturer (which was retitled as Assistant Professor (Teaching) later) in the <a href='https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/'>School of Science and Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en'>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen</a>, where I stayed until July 2025.</p>

            <p>I am currently a <a href='https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/HUANG-JUNBO/junbohuang'>Senior Lecturer</a> in the <a href='https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/education-innovation/college-of-education-sciences/'>College of Education Sciences</a> at <a href='https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>. I can be reached <a href='contact.html'>here</a>.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1cm;">I am passionate in promoting mathematics. My teaching experience can be found <a href='teaching.html'>here</a>.</p>
